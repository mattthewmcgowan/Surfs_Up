## Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to extract the data from a sqlite server and use that data to make informed decisions on where to potentially open a business. 
Understanding the data is crucial in this instance because of the nature of the potential business being primarly outside. 

Results: 

- The average temperature in June is 75 degrees with a standard deviatioin of 3 degrees. 

- The average temperature in December is 71 degrees with a standard deviation of 4 degrees. 

- The lowest recorded temperature is in December at 56 degrees. 

## Summary: 

Opening a location in this area would be ideal. Because the weather is relatively the same all year long we could expect business demand to remain the same all year long from a weather standpoint. The weather holds even during winter season when vacation travel is likely to spike. Another query that is worth considering is understanding how the temperature coorelates to the temperature of the surrounding water. Does the minimum temperature have any effect on ocean temperature? It would also be worth looking at the inverse effect of surrounding bodies of water. Should we account for wind speed that might make getting in the ocean not safe? If so, how frequently does that happen?
